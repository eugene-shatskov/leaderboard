Simple Leaderboard API
======================
<p>
Games often rely on leaderboards to promote competition among users. I am working on several small game ideas, and 
want to incorporate simple leaderboards into each. Rather than use an off-the-shelf solution, I decided to write my own 
to learn how to (a) build an efficient leaderboard service, and (b) create a RESTful API that is reusable and extensible.
